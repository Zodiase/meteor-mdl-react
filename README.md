Material Design Lite implemented with React for Meteor
======================================================

Basic logic is inherited from [Material Design Lite](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite) with modifications to take full advantage of React and abandon the useless `componentHandler`.

Can work together with Meteor package `zodiase:mdl` in case a component you are looking for has not been implemented yet.

Currently working on implementations based on Material Design Lite version 1.0.6.

Please see the README documents under each component to learn how to use them.
