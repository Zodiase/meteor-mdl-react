Material Design Lite implemented with React for Meteor
======================================================

Basic logic is inherited from [Material Design Lite](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite) with modifications to take full advantage of React and abandon the useless `componentHandler`.

**I'm slowly working on implementing these components when I need to use them in the Meteor apps I'm working on. So the order and priority of implementation is totally up to me. However if you are in need of certain components, let me know in the issues and I'll see if I can make it happen.**

~~Currently working on implementations based on Material Design Lite version 1.1.1.~~

The setup of this project actually allows me to have different versions for different components. So check each component to find out its version.

Can work together with Meteor package `zodiase:mdl` in case a component you are looking for has not been implemented yet.

Please see the README documents under each component to learn how to use them.
